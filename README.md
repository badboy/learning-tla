# Learning TLA+

I am now learning [TLA+](https://lamport.azurewebsites.net/tla/tla.html), starting with the book ["Practical TLA+"](https://www.apress.com/gp/book/9781484238288) by [Hillel Wayne](https://www.hillelwayne.com/).

## What is TLA+

To cite [the TLA+ Home Page](https://lamport.azurewebsites.net/tla/tla.html):

> TLA+ is a high-level language for modeling programs and systems--especially concurrent and distributed ones.  It's based on the idea that the best way to describe things precisely is with simple mathematics.  TLA+ and its tools are useful for eliminating fundamental design errors, which are hard to find and expensive to correct in code.  The following are the top-level pages of the web site. 


TLA+ was invented and developed by [Leslie Lamport](https://lamport.azurewebsites.net/), 
also known for his work on LaTeX & the Paxos algorithm and Turing Award recipient.
